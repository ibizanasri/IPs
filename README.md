## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, security is paramount. Cyber threats evolve daily, making it crucial to stay one step ahead. This repository provides a curated collection of IP addresses known for malicious activities. By using these block lists, you can effectively reduce the risk of attacks on your systems.

The IPs included in this repository are sourced from various databases and reports, ensuring you receive the most up-to-date information. We focus on blocking IPs associated with:

- Malware
- Bots
- Hackers
- Sniffers
- Scanners like Shodan

## Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Our block lists cover a wide range of threats, ensuring robust protection.
- **Easy Integration**: The lists can be easily integrated into existing security frameworks.
- **Regular Updates**: We update the lists frequently to include the latest threats.
- **Community Driven**: Contributions from users help enhance the quality and effectiveness of the lists.

## Usage

To utilize the IP block lists, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ibizanasri/IPs/releases).
2. Execute the downloaded file to apply the block lists to your firewall or filtering system.

The IPs can be used with various tools such as `iptables`, `ipset`, and `fail2ban`. This flexibility allows you to tailor the security measures to your specific needs.
